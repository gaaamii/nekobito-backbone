## Usage

  - Write Markdown text in the left window

### Save drafts on cloud
Nekobito uses [Dropbox Datastore API](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/datastore) as storage. By signing in with your Dropbox account, you can save drafts on cloud. Of course the text data is invisible for others because it would be related to your account.

### Keyboard Shortcuts

Ctrl + n : Open new text
Ctrl + s : Save text
Ctrl + d : Delete text
Ctrl + l : Open sidebar
```

#### When sidebar is opened

```
k: up

o: open
```
